## \#1 Driver arrives late for reserved time slot

#### Scenario
After successful reservation in the past, the chosen charging station (CS) is allocated and ready for charging. During the reserved slot, the CS could not be used from other EV users for charging their vehicles. 

#### Handling


## \#2 Power outage during reservation procedure

#### Scenario
During the reservation of the charging station (CS) a power outage takes place. This results in a disconnect between the charging station and the corresponding charging station management system (CSMS) for administration. 

#### Handling


## \#3 Power outage after reservation procedure

#### Scenario
After completion of the reservation process a power outage at the deployment area of the charging station takes place. 

#### Handling


## \#4 Connection to Charging Station Management System (CSMS) drops during reservation procedure

#### Scenario

#### Handling


## \#5 Connection to Charging Station Management System (CSMS) drops after reservation procedure

#### Scenario

#### Handling


## \#6 Driver blocks parking slot beyond the reservation

#### Scenario

#### Handling


## \#7 Driver does not arrive for reserved charging slot

#### Scenario

#### Handling


## \#8 Driver without reservation arrives at reserved charging station

#### Scenario

#### Handling


## \#9 Charging Stations (CS) handling offline scenarios

#### Scenario

#### Handling


## \#10 Connection drops to Charging Station Management System (CSMS) during charging the Electric Vehicle (EV)

#### Scenario
